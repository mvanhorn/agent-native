# Ship and Monitor

Use the normal `/ship` workflow, then add the post-merge monitoring described
below. Read `.agents/skills/ship/SKILL.md` and follow every step through
`/new-branch`; `/ship` intentionally ends after merge and branch rotation.

## Deployment split

Merges to `main` trigger `.github/workflows/deploy-beta-sites-prebuilt.yml`,
which builds in GitHub Actions and uploads prebuilt artifacts to the independent
Netlify beta sites at `beta.*.agent-native.com`. Netlify Git-connected
auto-builds are disabled, so do not wait for Netlify build queues or
deploy-preview checks; verify the Actions run and its per-site smoke checks.
Never cancel, re-dispatch, or pin duplicate beta publisher runs; automatic/handoff runs coalesce pending runs, manual runs use run-specific groups, and publishes serialize.
Verify on the first successful publish whose source contains your merge.
Production promotion is manual. A healthy beta deploy is not proof that
production changed, and a production deploy is not expected unless an explicit
manual promotion was started for the task. The public docs site is the
temporary exception: matching `main` changes trigger
`.github/workflows/deploy-docs-production.yml`, which publishes
`www.agent-native.com` directly and then disables its Git-connected Netlify
builds. There is no beta docs site today.

Use `.github/workflows/deploy-production-sites-prebuilt.yml` or the targeted
`promote-netlify-deploy.yml` workflow to promote a critical fix and let it
manage Netlify lock transitions. Do not manually remove or clear a Netlify lock
as a deployment step; clearing one is not the production promotion.

## Auth-path post-merge gate

When a merge changes Better Auth, OAuth callback/identity plumbing, or the
shared AuthPage/onboarding surface, beta deployment is only the built-runtime
checkpoint. After the affected beta sites deploy, dispatch both lanes below
from `main`, using the exact affected app ids:

```bash
gh workflow run beta-e2e.yml --ref main \
  -f lane=signup \
  -f signup_apps=<email-signup-affected-apps> \
  -f signup_environments=beta
gh workflow run beta-e2e.yml --ref main \
  -f lane=public+authed \
  -f apps=<affected-beta-apps>
```

The signup lane's `signup_apps` input is independent of the browser lane's
`apps` input. Wait for the signup job's classified output to be exactly
`success` and for the affected browser lane to pass. Complete each touched
Google callback in a real browser session as well; the seeded authenticated
lane deliberately excludes Google-only Mail and Calendar. A failure,
cancellation, inconclusive Mailosaur result, missing beta deploy, or untested
provider path stays Open - do not report the auth fix as done.

## Post-merge monitoring

After `/new-branch`:

1. Confirm the merged PR and merge commit are present in `origin/main`.
2. Check every workflow attached to that commit, the beta deployment status,
   and package publication when applicable. Wait for publication and use an
   independent beta URL smoke check when the affected surface is observable.
3. If the task changed docs, verify the docs production workflow and
   `www.agent-native.com` separately. If the task explicitly included manual
   promotion of another production site, verify that promotion and its URL
   separately. Otherwise report those other production sites as intentionally
   not promoted, not as blocked by Netlify.
4. Re-read the merged PR for new review or bot feedback. If actionable
   post-merge feedback or a release/deploy failure appears, fix it on the fresh
   branch, run the smallest meaningful check, and invoke `/ship` for the
   follow-up.

Keep configured, source-tested, built-runtime, beta-deployed, production-
promoted, and observed-live claims separate. A merge or green test is not live
proof.
